# Hare

Experimental web server written in Ruby. This is a toy project that I'm
using as a learning tool. It (eventually) interfaces with Rack directly.
The goal is to be Rails and Sinatra compatible.

### Status of this project

This project is not usable in any way yet. It's still very very alpha
yet and many core components have still to be built.
